# Gaussian splats for ShapeNet
You can use this repo to create Gaussian splats on ShapeNet models. We run it on ShapeNetCore.v2.
## Installation
We use blender 3.6.13 to render the objects, you can download it [here](https://www.blender.org/download/release/Blender3.6/blender-3.6.13-linux-x64.tar.xz). After extracting blender, please go to ```/path/to/blender/3.6/python/bin/python3.10``` and install ```numpy```, ```opencv-python```, ```trimesh``` and ```plyfile```.
